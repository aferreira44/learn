# Hooks

## useState
## useEffect

- Run when mounted
- Run when state changes
- Run before component is removed from UI

## useContext

- Context shate data between components without passing props
- createContext() creates a context object
- Provider component provides the context to the children
- useContext() hook to consume the context

## useRef

- Mutable value that does not re-render UI
- Grab native HTML elements from JSX

## useReducer

- Alternative to useState, similar to Redux
- Action -> reducer -> store -> UI
- Why use it? It helps with complex state logic and bigger applications

## useMemo

- Memoization cache result of function call
- Avoid expensive calculations on every render
- Use only as needed for expensive calculations
- Recompute only if dependencies change

## useCallback

## useImperativeHandle

## useLayoutEffect

## useDebugValue

- Runs after render but before screen update
- Synchronous, blocks visual updates
