## Writing the “Hello, World!” Program

To write the “Hello, World!” program, let’s open up a command-line text editor such as nano and create a new file:

```bash
nano hello.py
```

Once the text file opens up in the terminal window we’ll type out our program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Running the “Hello, World!” Program
With our “Hello, World!” program written, we are ready to run the program. We’ll use the `python3` command along with the name of our program file. Let’s run the program:

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

The hello.py program that you created will cause your terminal to produce the following output:

```
Hello, World!
```
