# Python Comments

- Comments can be used to explain Python code.
- Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
- Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Comments starts with a `#`, and Python will ignore them:

```python
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
```

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

```python
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment.
```

A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

```python
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```

## Multiline Comments

- Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
- To add a multiline comment you could insert a `#` for each line:

```python
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
