# Basic Syntax

Setup the environment for python and get started with the basics.

## Execute Python Code

- Open the terminal and type `python` to open the python interpreter.
- Type `print("Hello World")` and press enter to execute the code.
- Type `exit()` to exit the interpreter.

## Execute Python File

- Create a file named `hello.py` and add the following code.

```python
print("Hello World")
```

- Open the terminal and type `python hello.py` to execute the code.

## Python Indentation

- Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
- The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
- Indentation can be ignored in line continuation, but it's always a good idea to indent.
- It makes the code more readable.

```python
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
```

Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

```python
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
```

You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

```python
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")
```
