thirdweb is a complete web3 development framework that provides everything you need to connect your apps and games to decentralized networks.

## thirdweb React SDK

- https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/tree/main/packages/react

A collection of 100+ React hooks and UI components for your web3 apps, for any EVM-compatible blockchain.

Connect to userâ€™s wallets, interact with smart contracts, sign messages, and utilize common standards such as tokens, NFTs, marketplaces; all with built-in caching, RPC URLs, IPFS gateways, and more.

### How it works

- https://portal.thirdweb.com/react#how-it-works

The React SDK uses React Query under the hood to expose a collection of query and mutation hooks, each with built-in caching, query invalidation, query retries, and more.

Each hook (except for wallet/network management) wraps some functionality of the TypeScript SDK, which are made available as either a query hook to read data, or as a mutation hook to write transactions to the blockchain.

When mutations are called (when a user executes a transaction), query invalidation is automatically triggered to update the relevant queries that depend on the data that was changed. For example, when minting a new NFT, queries that view information about NFTs are re-fetched to load the new NFT automatically.
