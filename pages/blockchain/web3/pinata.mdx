# Pinata

Pinata is an NFT media management service that allows users to host, manage and share files of any kind on the blockchain of their choice.

As an IPFS pinning service, we focus on giving both technical and non-technical creators a fast, easy, and reliable way to share content without limits.

For developers, Pinata is the easiest way to pin content to IPFS and build web3 applications without having to build and manage your own IPFS nodes. We do all the heavy lifting for you.

For creators, Pinata makes it easy to serve content at scale without any technical experience. We offer anyone the ability to start creating without having to worry about the technical side of web3 or IPFS right away.

## IPFS

IPFS is a peer-to-peer network and protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS is a decentralized alternative to HTTP, the protocol used to transfer data over the web. IPFS is a peer-to-peer network and protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

The InterPlanetary File System, also known as IPFS, is an incredibly powerful protocol that allows creators to host content too large for blockchains on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, leveraging cryptography to ensure content is unable to be changed.

The IPFS network is ideal for NFT projects that want to decentralize (transfer control from a centralized entity to a distributed network) their NFT media and make sure it does not change over time. IPFS also allows creators to take ownership of their content and how they share it.

### Pinning

When you “pin” data on an IPFS node, you are telling that node that the data is important and it should be saved. A node is a program that connects you to IPFS and stores files.</span></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="css-175oi2r r-1ro0kt6 r-16y2uox r-1wbh5a2"><div class="view_SggA- flex_jZskO blockWrapper_y0Ubs"><div data-rnwr1490-1777fci="true" data-rnwr700-1777fci="true" class="css-175oi2r r-1ro0kt6 r-16y2uox r-1wbh5a2 r-18u37iz r-1777fci"><div class="css-175oi2r r-1ro0kt6 r-16y2uox r-1wbh5a2"><div class="css-175oi2r"><div class="css-175oi2r"><div data-key="e66ecf0c27d54852ad3e297e9ab37bc2" class="view_SggA- flex_jZskO block_UxARL mediumVertical_-Vaii smallTop_crzBC smallBottom_BmSGf"><div data-block-content="e66ecf0c27d54852ad3e297e9ab37bc2" class="r-1oszu61 r-1xc7w19 r-1phboty r-1yadl64 r-deolkf r-6koalj r-eqz5dr r-crgep1 r-ifefl9 r-bcqeeo r-t60dpp r-bnwqim r-417010 r-1ro0kt6 r-16y2uox r-1wbh5a2"><div dir="auto" class="css-1rynq56 r-gg6oyi r-ubezar r-16dba41 r-135wba7 r-z9jf92 r-fdjqy7 r-1xnzce8"><span data-key="5d419ad6f1a84bc48b2ae5f6680051be"><span data-offset-key="5d419ad6f1a84bc48b2ae5f6680051be:0">Pinning prevents important data from being deleted from your node. You and only you can control and pin data on your node(s)—you can not force other nodes on the IPFS network to pin your content for you. So, to guarantee your content stays pinned, you have to run your own IPFS nodes.

Once your file is pinned to IPFS, you have full control to share, distribute, monetize and share your files however you’d like.
